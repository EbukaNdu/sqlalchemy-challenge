# sqlalchemy-challenge


In this challenge the analysis involved retrieving precipitation data for the last 12 months. The most recent date in the dataset was determined with data from the previous 12 months queried. I displayed the Precipitation data using a line plot, showing the variation in precipitation over time.
Summary statistics, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum precipitation values, was calculated and presented.

The total number of stations in the dataset was determined and they were ranked based on observation counts to identify the most active station.
I calculated the temperature statistics (minimum, maximum, and average temperatures) for the most active station and retrieved the temperature observations for the most active station from the previous 12 months and visualized them using a histogram.

Overall, the analysis provides insights into the precipitation patterns and temperature variations in Honolulu, Hawaii, which can be valuable for tourists and locals alike in planning activities and understanding the local climate trends. Additionally, the Flask API facilitates easy access to the analyzed data for further exploration and integration into other applications.

collabed with fellow classmate Ben on fixing my flask api section along with referencing chat gpt and xpert learning to further fix the code.
